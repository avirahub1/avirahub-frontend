# IMPORTANT: Do NOT use @netlify/plugin-nextjs for static export
# Static export generates static HTML files, not a server-side Next.js app
# Netlify will auto-detect Next.js - we need to override this behavior

# Environment variables should be set in Netlify UI:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (e.g., https://avirahub-backend.onrender.com/api)
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL (e.g., https://avirahub.in)

# Redirects are handled by Next.js static export automatically
# No additional redirects needed unless you have specific requirements
